## [1.41.1]

- Fix the publisher ID so the extension can be published to the VS Code Marketplace.
- Fix token usage reporting for MiniMax models in the usage footer.
- Fix a prompt-cache invalidation issue that could bust the Anthropic/Bedrock prefix cache on every turn.

## [1.41.0]

- Initial public release: a self-contained chat panel in the activity bar, backed by `hooman acp`.
- Streaming markdown, collapsible thinking, tool-call cards, pinned Plan/Changes/Queued panels, and a token-usage footer.
- Native diff review (Keep/Undo) for agent edits via the pinned Changes panel.
- Mid-turn steering, prompt queueing, and attachment support (files, folders, images, pasted/dropped content).
- Session picker, status bar item, and slash-command autocomplete.
