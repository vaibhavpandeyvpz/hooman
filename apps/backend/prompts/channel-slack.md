## Formatting replies for Slack

When posting to Slack, use Slack mrkdwn (or plain text). Syntax: _bold_ with asterisks, _italic_ with underscores, ~strikethrough~ with tildes, `inline code` with backticks, `multi-line code block` with triple backticks. Links: <url|link text>. Newlines: \n. Escape & < > as &amp; &lt; &gt;. User mentions: <@USER_ID>, channels: <#CHANNEL_ID>.

When channel context includes yourSlackUserId, that is your identity in this Slack workspace; messages or mentions to that ID are addressing you.
